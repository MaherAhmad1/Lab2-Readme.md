# Hardware, Hard Drives, and Memory


### Hardware
The role of the CPU or Central Processing Unit is that it carries out any commands sent to it by other software and retunrs the results to be acted upon.Some of the components are clock time, which is the speed of a cpu measured in hertz. A hertz is defined as one cycle per second. A kilohertz is one thousand cycles per second, and a megahertz is one million cycles per second. These are the main components of a CPU.

### Hard Drives
Within the storage world there are a few devices you can use, two of them being a regular hard drive, and then the solid state drive. The main difference between these two devices in a nice short way of saying it is that a hard drive is the traditional storage device that uses mechanical platters, and a moving write/read head to use the data it has on it, while a solid state drive takes the data directly to an instantly accesible memory chip saving you a lot of time. 

### Memory
RAM or Random Access Memory is an important part of computers because it is a high speed component that for a short time stores all the information your device needs at the moment and will need shortly after. Adding more RAM to your computer allows it to be able to have more applications open at the same time, increasing the amount of workload your computer can handle. An example to help better understand this is that lets say application A requies 3gb of RAM and you only have 2gb, then it will run slower than it is intended to and the chance of the application crashing is higher than it should be, but if you add more RAM and now have 6gb you will be able to run the program in the intended way it was made to run.
