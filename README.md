# Hardware, Hard Drives, and Memory
The role of the CPU or Central Processing Unit is that it carries out any commands sent to it by other software and retunrs the results to be acted upon.Some of the components are clock time, which is the speed of a cpu measured in hertz. A hertz is defined as one cycle per second. A kilohertz is one thousand cycles per second, and a megahertz is one million cycles per second. These are the main components of a CPU.

Within the storage world there are a few devices you can use, two of them being a regular hard drive, and then the solid state drive. The main difference between these two devices in a nice short way of saying it is that a hard drive is the traditional storage device that uses mechanical platters, and a moving write/read head to use the data it has on it, while a solid state drive takes the data directly to an instantly accesible memory chip saving you a lot of time.
