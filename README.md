# Hardware, Hard Drives, and Memory


### Hardware
The role of the CPU or Central Processing Unit is that it carries out any commands sent to it by other software and retunrs the results to be acted upon.Some of the components are clock time, which is the speed of a cpu measured in hertz. A hertz is defined as one cycle per second. A kilohertz is one thousand cycles per second, and a megahertz is one million cycles per second. These are the main components of a CPU.

### Hard Drives
Within the storage world there are a few devices you can use, two of them being a regular hard drive, and then the solid state drive. The main difference between these two devices in a nice short way of saying it is that a hard drive is the traditional storage device that uses mechanical platters, and a moving write/read head to use the data it has on it, while a solid state drive takes the data directly to an instantly accesible memory chip saving you a lot of time. 

### Memory
RAM or Random Access Memory is an important part of computers because it is a high speed component that for a short time stores all the information your device needs at the moment and will need shortly after. Adding more RAM to your computer allows it to be able to have more applications open at the same time, increasing the amount of workload your computer can handle. An example to help better understand this is that lets say application A requies 3gb of RAM and you only have 2gb, then it will run slower than it is intended to and the chance of the application crashing is higher than it should be, but if you add more RAM and now have 6gb you will be able to run the program in the intended way it was made to run. Let's talk about bits. A bit is a single character in binary, either a 1 or 0. One bit can express two values so one bit equals two and two bits equals four, im sure you get the point. A 32 bit processor can handle 4gb of memory or RAM, while a 64 bit proccesor can handle a whopping 16 million gbs of memory or RAM. The main difference between these two bit data paths is the way they handle and address memory. Having a 64 bit will allow you to run your computer at it's maximum speed possible while running a 32 bit path might cause some inefficiencies so it may have to rely on the hard drive to help it out with it's processing power.

### Hardware: ALU and the Control Unit
Within the CPU an interaction takes place where the ALU and and control unit must work together to perfrom operations. To say it simply the ALU perfroms simple math such as addition and multiplication, then that data gets stored into a memory, and lastly the control unit will get that data and it's instructions to perfrom the action that is needed.

### Hardware: CPU, Input & Outout
The example addresses each of the components by first getting input which is the conversion of an action (you scaaning the item you wish to buy) into binary. With the computer now having binary code it goes to the CPU where it will store the results into memory. The last part is output which in this scenerio would be a monitor to display the items you will be buying.

### Hardware: Logic Gates 
The purpose of a truth table is to show the output you get for every possible input. This applies to the computing process by showing us the results of the functional expression so we can get our answers.

### Hardware: IEEE Ethically Aligned Design
The purpose of the IEEE is to advance innovation and technological excellence to better humanity. The importance of ethics in device design is to ensure safe and fair practices so people do not get hurt and everyone has an equal opprotunity to better the world in a technological format.
